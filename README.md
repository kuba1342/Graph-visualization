# Graph-visualization

Desktop app for graph algorithms visualization.




App allows to test the algorithms with simple predefined graph networks or with graphs designed by the user. The application was written using the C++ programming language and the openFrameworks tool to create visuals. Three different graph algorithms can be tested with it: Dijsktra shortest path, DFS (*depth-first search*) and BFS (*breadth-first search*), the latter in the general variant as well as with the ability to find the shortest path.


Features:
- creating your own graph network based on text file,
- DFS, BFS and Dijsktra,
- simple graph networks, 3 x 3 and 4 x 4 available by default, 
- dynamic, color based interface, 
- automatic path finding process based on short time intervals,
- manual steering,
